ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ **SPOILER ALERT**: It's obvious that my experience is more than positive. If you have another experience, not that good please feel free to share it in the comments section below.

Recently, I joined a maritime startup, [Seafair](https://www.seafair.io/). 

Seafair is a tech startup offering maritime companies a digital marketplace to hire seafarers and software to manage seafarers onboard (contracts, work schedules, trainings, payments). Since its launch in 2020 it [has raised $7M](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/maritime-recruitment-platform-seafair-gets-5-7m-led-by-general-catalyst/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9tYWlsLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMoovP0tmx10iYWH-wOZ_lResztwxeVSomE8bPSLIG_1D3s0vDB9NtuKn27PmFqVYYijf6Bmix6AxWG3wQR8mwLESAZX8aIKGCGtwzhfssCh6Gp7ZbhHRdImD0VXOnn2ofdqo-4t0p1aEPocT7hfHjlbhhSZuCagBRX8uYzDepQ3) and operates out of NYC, Berlin, Athens, Manila and Odessa.



**Disclaimer**: I may be a little biased because I have great teammates on this joyful journey. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that joining a startup at your early career could do much more good than harm.
