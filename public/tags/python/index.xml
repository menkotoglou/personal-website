      <description>The project is based on a “profanity-check” library created by Victor Zhou. You can read more about it here and find it online here: https://github.com/vzhou842/profanity-check. Firstly, we installed the library in a virtual environment and experimented with different samples.
We tested the model with an internal dataset consisting of 850 tweets retrieved through Twitter’s sampling API then labeled manually. This produced the following results:

Unfortunately, it seems that its original author never accepted our previous Pull Request to revive the profanity-check package. As a result, Github issues were kept being opened by other developers asking about the library and issues they had while using it. What surprised us the most, was this one: https://github.</description>
